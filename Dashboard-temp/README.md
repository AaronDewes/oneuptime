-   Reactjs - UI Library

## Start

To run the app:

In development.
Consider adding PORT=3002 to a .env in the project root because razzle and express server and webpack dev server will use port 3000 and 3002 causing port conflict with the backend that usually runs on port 3002

```
 npm run dev
```

In production:

```
 npm start
```
