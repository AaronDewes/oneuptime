  <h3>Introduction</h3>

  <p>A SOC 2 report is designed to provide assurances about the effectiveness of controls in place at a service
    organisation that are relevant to the security, availability, or processing integrity of the system used to process
    clients’ information, or the confidentiality or privacy of that information.
    <br /><br />
    Companies that use cloud service providers use SOC 2 reports to assess and address the risks associated with third
    party technology services. These reports are issued by independent third-party auditors.
