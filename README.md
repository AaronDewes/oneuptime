# OneUptime

OneUptime is an open-source complete SRE and DevOps platform. 

OneUptime monitors your website, dashboards, API's, and more and alerts your team when downtime happens. We also give you a Status Page which keeps your customers looped in and improves transparency.

OneUptime does: 
- Uptime Monitoring just like Pingdom
- Status Page just like StatusPage.io
- Tests just like Postman
- Security just like Snyk
- Logs Management just like Loggly
- Incident Management just like PagerDuty
- Performance Monitoring just like NewRelic
- Error Tracking just like Sentry

All under one platform.
