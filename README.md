OneUptime is an open-source complete SRE and DevOps platform.

OneUptime monitors your website, dashboards, API's, and more and alerts your team when downtime happens. We also give you a Status Page which keeps your customers looped in and improves transparency.

OneUptime does:

-   Uptime Monitoring just like Pingdom
-   Status Page just like StatusPage.io
-   Tests just like Postman
-   Security just like Snyk
-   Logs Management just like Loggly
-   Incident Management just like PagerDuty
-   Performance Monitoring just like NewRelic
-   Error Tracking just like Sentry

All under one platform.
